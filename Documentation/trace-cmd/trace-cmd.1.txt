TRACE-CMD(1)
============

NAME
----
trace-cmd - interacts with Ftrace Linux kernel internal tracer

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd* 'COMMAND' ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) command interacts with the Ftrace tracer that is built inside
the Linux kernel. It interfaces with the Ftrace specific files found in the
debugfs file system under the tracing directory. A 'COMMAND' must be
specified to tell trace-cmd what to do.


COMMANDS
--------

  record  - record a live trace and write a trace.dat file to the
            local disk or to the network.

  set     - set a ftrace configuration parameter.

  report  - reads a trace.dat file and converts the binary data to a
            ASCII text readable format.

  stream  - Start tracing and read the output directly

  profile - Start profiling and read the output directly

  hist    - show a histogram of the events.

  stat    - show tracing (ftrace) status of the running system

  options - list the plugin options that are available to *report*

  start   - start the tracing without recording to a trace.dat file.

  stop    - stop tracing (only disables recording, overhead of tracer
            is still in effect)

  restart - restart tracing from a previous stop (only effects recording)

  extract - extract the data from the kernel buffer and create a trace.dat
            file.

  show    - display the contents of one of the Ftrace Linux kernel tracing files

  reset   - disables all tracing and gives back the system performance.
            (clears all data from the kernel buffers)

  clear   - clear the content of the Ftrace ring buffers.

  split   - splits a trace.dat file into smaller files.

  list    - list the available plugins or events that can be recorded.

  listen  - open up a port to listen for remote tracing connections.

  agent   - listen on a vsocket for trace clients

  setup-guest - create FIFOs for tracing guest VMs

  restore - restore the data files of a crashed run of trace-cmd record

  snapshot- take snapshot of running trace

  stack   - run and display the stack tracer

  check-events - parse format strings for all trace events and return
                 whether all formats are parseable

  convert   - convert trace files

  attach   - attach a host trace.dat file to a guest trace.dat file

  dump    - read out the meta data from a trace file

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*, --help::
    Display the help text.

Other options see the man page for the corresponding command.
